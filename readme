In DEV Environment:

    use nodemon and babel from your local machine
    launch the docker redis container
        cd redis-dev
        docker-compose up -d
        docker-compose stop (to stop)

In prod:
    In the root folder:
        docker-compose build (To create the docker images, needed just one only time)
        docker-compose up -d (Start the containers)
        docker-compose stop  (Stop all the docker-compose.yml running containers)
